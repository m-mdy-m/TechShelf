# **Data Structures**

## What are Data Structures?

Data structures are specialized formats for organizing, processing, retrieving, and storing data efficiently within a computer system. They define how data is logically arranged and managed in memory, enhancing how algorithms perform on that data. Common examples of data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables. Each structure has specific strengths and weaknesses that make it suitable for different types of applications. For instance, arrays allow fast access to elements but have fixed sizes, whereas linked lists enable dynamic memory allocation but have slower access times. By using appropriate data structures, programmers can write more efficient and scalable code, ensuring faster data processing, better memory utilization, and overall optimized performance.
