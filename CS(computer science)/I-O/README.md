## **CS (Computer Science)-Input-Output(I/O)**

### What is Input-Output (I/O)?

Input and Output (I/O) in computer science refers to the communication between an information processing system, like a computer, and the outside world, which could be a human user, another system, or a device. This interaction involves reading data from input devices or sources and writing data to output devices or destinations. Understanding I/O operations is fundamental for developing efficient software, as it often impacts program performance and user interaction.
