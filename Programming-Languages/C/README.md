# **Programming-Languages-C**

## What is C?

C is a high-level programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s. It is a general-purpose, procedural language that supports structured programming and provides low-level access to memory, making it suitable for system programming such as developing operating systems, compilers, and embedded systems. C is known for its efficiency, portability, and a robust standard library.

Câ€™s simplicity and close relationship with hardware have made it a cornerstone in the evolution of many modern programming languages like C++, Java, and Python.
