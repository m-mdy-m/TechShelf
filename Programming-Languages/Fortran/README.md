# **Programming-Languages-Fortran**

## What is Fortran?

**Fortran** is one of the oldest high-level programming languages, initially developed in the 1950s for scientific and engineering computations. Known for its numerical and data-heavy processing capabilities, Fortran has evolved significantly over the decades, with major versions like Fortran 77, Fortran 90, and Fortran 95 introducing new features to improve its functionality, readability, and efficiency. Despite its age, Fortran remains popular in fields requiring high-performance computing, such as physics, engineering, and computational chemistry, due to its efficiency and extensive mathematical libraries.
