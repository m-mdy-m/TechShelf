# **Programming-Languages-Assembly**

## What is Assembly?

**Assembly language** is a low-level programming language that provides a direct interface to a computerâ€™s hardware. It consists of a set of instructions that correspond directly to machine code instructions, allowing developers to write programs that operate at the hardware level with more control over memory management, processor operations, and data handling. Assembly languages are often specific to a particular computer architecture, such as x86 or ARM, and are widely used in systems programming, embedded systems, and situations where performance optimization is critical.
