# **Programming-Languages-Assembly-x64**

## What is Assembly-x64?

**Assembly x64** refers to the assembly language specifically designed for the x86-64 architecture, an extension of the x86 architecture that supports 64-bit computing. This assembly language provides low-level control over system resources and enables programmers to write highly optimized code for performance-critical applications, operating systems, and system utilities. x64 assembly language allows direct manipulation of CPU registers, memory, and hardware devices, making it crucial for developers working close to the hardware.
