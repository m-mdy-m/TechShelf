# **Programming-Languages-Assembly-x86**

## What is Assembly-x86?

**x86 Assembly Language** is the assembly language used for the x86 architecture, a popular instruction set for personal computers and embedded systems. x86 assembly provides low-level control over hardware, allowing programmers to interact directly with a CPU’s registers, memory, and other resources. This language is widely used for performance-critical applications, operating systems, and systems programming due to its efficiency and ability to execute fine-grained hardware operations.
