# **ML**

## What is ML?

**ML** (Meta Language) is a family of functional programming languages known for their strong type systems and type inference capabilities. The most popular dialects of ML include **Standard ML (SML)** and **OCaml**. ML languages are designed for general-purpose programming and are widely used in various fields, including:

- **Theoretical computer science**: Due to their strong type systems and functional programming paradigms.
- **Compiler construction**: Many compiler tools and systems are built using ML.
- **Formal verification**: ML is used in theorem proving and formal methods.
- **Data analysis**: Some use ML for numerical and statistical computations.
