# **Algorithms - String - Searching**

## What is String Searching?

String searching refers to the process of finding a specific substring or pattern within a larger string. It is a fundamental problem in computer science with applications in text processing, pattern matching, search engines, and bioinformatics. String searching algorithms aim to locate the presence of a string (or pattern) efficiently within another string, often leveraging advanced techniques for speed and optimization.
