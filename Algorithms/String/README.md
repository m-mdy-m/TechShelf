# **Algorithms - String**

## What is String?

A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text or data in computer programming. Strings are fundamental data structures used in various applications, including text processing, data storage, and manipulation. Common operations on strings include searching, matching, replacing, concatenating, and splitting. Strings are usually handled by algorithms to optimize performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.
