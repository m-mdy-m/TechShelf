# **Algorithms - String-Manipulation**

## What is String Manipulation?

String manipulation is the process of modifying, analyzing, and handling strings (a sequence of characters) in computer programming. Common operations include searching for substrings, replacing characters, splitting, joining, reversing, and comparing strings. String manipulation is essential for text processing tasks in various domains like search engines, text editors, compilers, and data processing.
