# **Algorithms**

## What is Algorithms?

A defined calculation method (completely defined) that takes a long time to take a value from the input and produce a value! So the algorithm is a sequence of calculations
Steps that convert input into output It can also be said that the algorithm is a tool for solving calculations! 
> (that is, both a calculation method and a tool for calculation)
In general, algorithms provide a specific computational method to establish the relationship between inputs and outputs for all types of problems.
