### **Algorithms - Arithmetic**

## **What is Arithmetic?**
Arithmetic refers to the branch of mathematics dealing with basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. When applied to algorithms, arithmetic focuses on optimizing these operations for efficient computation. Arithmetic algorithms are crucial in areas like cryptography, computer graphics, and computational number theory, where precise and high-speed arithmetic computations are essential.
