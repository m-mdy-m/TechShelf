### **Algorithms - Arithmetic**

## **What is Arithmetic?**

Arithmetic algorithms refer to the methods and computational steps used to perform basic and advanced mathematical operations on numbers. These algorithms form the foundation for a wide range of mathematical computations, from elementary addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to more complex operations like modular arithmetic, exponentiation, and cryptographic functions. Understanding arithmetic algorithms is essential in fields such as computer science, cryptography, machine learning, and scientific computing, where precise and efficient calculations are required. These algorithms are optimized for accuracy and speed, allowing computers to handle large-scale calculations and ensure the security of data through techniques like encryption.
