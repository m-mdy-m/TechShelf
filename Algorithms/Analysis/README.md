# **Algorithms-Analysis**

## What is Analysis?

**Algorithm analysis** is a key area within computational complexity theory, which estimates the theoretical resources required by an algorithm to solve a given computational problem. It plays a critical role in determining how efficiently an algorithm performs, particularly in terms of time and space.

Most algorithms are designed to handle inputs of arbitrary length, meaning the algorithm must perform regardless of the size of the data. Analyzing algorithms helps us understand their performance for different input sizes, providing insights into the scalability and efficiency of an algorithm. The efficiency of an algorithm is commonly expressed in terms of:

- **Time Complexity**: This measures how the runtime of an algorithm changes as the input size increases. It is often represented by Big-O notation, which provides an upper bound on the time it takes for the algorithm to run based on input size.
- **Space Complexity**: This measures how much memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. It is crucial for understanding how much additional storage is required when executing the algorithm.
