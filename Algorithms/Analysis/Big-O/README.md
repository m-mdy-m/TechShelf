# **Algorithms-BigO**

## What is BigO?

Big O notation is a mathematical concept used in computer science to describe the efficiency of algorithms in terms of their time and space complexity. It provides an upper bound on the runtime or memory usage of an algorithm relative to the size of the input, helping developers understand how an algorithm will perform as input size grows. Common Big O notations include $O(1)$ for constant time, $O(\log n)$ for logarithmic time, $O(n)$ for linear time, $O(n^2)$ for quadratic time, and $O(2^n)$ for exponential time. Understanding Big O is crucial for optimizing code and ensuring scalability.
