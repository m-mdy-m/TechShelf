## What is Information-Theory?

In 1948, Claude Shannon published a paper called _A Mathematical Theory of Communication_ , which marked a significant turning point in our understanding of information. Before Shannon’s paper, information had been regarded as an abstract, somewhat undefined concept a kind of miasmic fluid without a clear structure. However, after Shannon's work, it became evident that information could be quantified and measured in a precise way. Shannon’s key contribution was to demonstrate that information, much like physical quantities such as mass or energy, could be treated systematically and mathematically. This led to the establishment of a rigorous, measurable understanding of information.
According to **Merriam-Webster** [merriam-webster.com](merriam-webster.com), “Information is any entity or form that provides the answer to a question of some kind or resolves uncertainty.” This definition illustrates the relationship between data, information, and knowledge: data refers to raw values or facts attributed to parameters, while knowledge represents a deeper understanding of real-world phenomena or abstract concepts. Information, then, lies between these two—transforming data into something meaningful by resolving uncertainty or answering questions. However, modern Information Theory does not concern itself directly with these abstract relationships between data, information, and knowledge. Instead, it provides a mathematical framework for modeling and analyzing the transmission and processing of information, especially in communication systems..
