# **Programming - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

## What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which represent both data and functions that manipulate that data. Unlike procedural programming, where the focus is on functions and sequences of tasks, OOP organizes code into reusable objects, making it easier to model real-world systems and develop complex applications. Key principles of OOP include encapsulation (bundling data and methods), inheritance (creating new objects based on existing ones), polymorphism (allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class), and abstraction (simplifying complex reality by modeling classes). This approach promotes modularity, maintainability, and flexibility in software development.
