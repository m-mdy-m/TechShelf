## **What is Parser?**

A parser is a software component that takes input data (usually text) and builds a data structure — often some kind of parse tree, abstract syntax tree, or other hierarchical structure — giving it a formal representation based on the syntax of a language. Parsers are widely used in compilers, natural language processing, data analysis, and more.
