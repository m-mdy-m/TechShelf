# **Programming-Expressions-Operators**

## **What are Expressions and Operators?**

Expressions are combinations of variables, constants, and operators that produce a value when evaluated. In programming, expressions play a crucial role in defining how data is manipulated and combined, allowing for complex calculations and logical operations. Operators, on the other hand, are symbols or keywords used within expressions to perform specific tasks, such as arithmetic, comparison, logical, or bitwise operations.
