# **Data-Type**

## What is Data-Type?

Every program, regardless of complexity, deals with data—either directly or indirectly—to produce a result. Programs define a sequence of operations applied to specific data to achieve desired outputs. Data, in its most fundamental form, consists of binary units known as bits inside a computer. These bits are grouped, interpreted, and processed in specific ways depending on the programming language and context. Differences among programming languages typically arise in three key areas:

Types of data allowed: Each programming language defines the types of data that can be used.
Operations available on data: Programming languages specify different sets of operations that can be performed on data types.
Control over operation sequences: Languages provide mechanisms to control the order of operations executed on data.
Most programming languages include a set of primitive data types (e.g., integers, booleans, characters) and mechanisms for building more complex types (e.g., arrays, structures). These data types are fundamental to how the language manipulates and stores information.
