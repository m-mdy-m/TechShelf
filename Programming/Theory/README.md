### **Programming Theory**

## **What is Theory?**
Programming theory is the study of computational principles and abstract models that underpin programming languages, algorithms, and computational systems. It encompasses foundational concepts such as computability, complexity, automata theory, and formal language theory. This theoretical background helps to understand the limits of computation, the efficiency of algorithms, and the structures of programming languages. Programming theory is crucial for those aiming to design more efficient algorithms, develop new programming languages, or optimize existing systems.
