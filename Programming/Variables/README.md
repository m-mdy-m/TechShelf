## **Variables**

In programming, a **variable** is a symbolic reference to a memory location where data is stored. It essentially acts as a container that allows programs to store, retrieve, and manipulate values as needed throughout the execution of the code. Variables are fundamental to programming because they enable data storage in a flexible, accessible way. By assigning values to variables, programmers can perform operations like mathematical calculations, manage strings, and track information through program logic.
