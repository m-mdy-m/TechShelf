# **Variables**

## What is Variables?

A **variable** in programming is a symbolic name associated with a memory location in the computer. It acts as a container for storing data that the program can use, modify, or retrieve at any point during its execution. The value stored in a variable can change or vary, hence the name "variable." By associating a value with a variable, a program can reference and operate on that value in various operations, such as mathematical calculations or string manipulations.
