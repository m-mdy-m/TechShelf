# **Computer-Architecture - Memory Hierarchy - Cache**

## What is Cache?

Cache is a high-speed storage mechanism in a computer's memory hierarchy that stores frequently accessed data closer to the processor, ensuring faster retrieval and processing times. It serves as an intermediary between the main memory (RAM) and the CPU, significantly reducing the latency associated with accessing data from slower memory storage. Understanding cache architecture, design, and management is crucial for optimizing performance, improving system efficiency, and minimizing memory bottlenecks in modern computing systems.
